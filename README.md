### SolidJS spreadsheet web app

My goal right now would be to render virtualized grid and add basic functions (arithmetic formulas, cell formatting, etc.)
to ultimately produce similar to Excel's workflow feel.

#### Todo:

- [x] initialize virtualized grid
- [ ] set/get cells
- [ ] add base for formulas (`=` to assign value of another cell with `$`)
