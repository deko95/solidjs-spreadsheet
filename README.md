### [SolidJS spreadsheet web app](https://solidjs-spreadsheet.vercel.app)

My goal right now would be to render virtualized grid and add basic functions (arithmetic formulas, cell formatting, etc.)
to ultimately produce similar to Excel's workflow feel.

---

#### Todo:

- [x] initialize virtualized grid
- [x] set/get cells
- [x] add base for formulas (`=` to assign value of another cell - `=A1`)
- [x] reactive `=`
- [x] track references down to values
- [ ] display columns and rows indexes, duh
- [ ] very basic import/export
